    "text": "In Class I have been learning about how to utilize Pandas in my data cleaning and analysis. One of the earliest functions we learned is the .apply() function. This is a super useful function that we can use to make changes to all of our rows in one call.\nThe downside is, it isn’t always the most efficient. This often wont make a huge difference but if we are working with large data sets, it can cut your run time down by a lot.\nIn this article, I hope to explain:\n\nHow does .apply() work?\nWhen should we use it?\nWhat is the alternative?\n\nHaving an understanding of apply() and its shortcomings will help you spend less time waiting on your computer and make you a better Data Scientist\n\n\n\n\nThe .apply() function takes another function and applies it to each row or column in a Series or DataFrame.\nIf it sounds like a loop, that’s because it kind of is one.\n\n.apply() executes Python code row-by-row.\n\nThis is the main shortcoming, rather than doing things all at once, its going through, one at a time and this takes time while simultaneously not allowing your computer to work as hard as it could using other methods.This is why the difference is much more noticeable on larger datasets.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"score\": [72, 88, 95, 60, 83]\n})\n\ndef pass_fail(x):\n    return \"Pass\" if x &gt;= 70 else \"Fail\"\n\ndf[\"result\"] = df[\"score\"].apply(pass_fail)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\nresult\n\n\n\n\n0\n72\nPass\n\n\n1\n88\nPass\n\n\n2\n95\nPass\n\n\n3\n60\nFail\n\n\n4\n83\nPass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great use for apply(), it keeps the code intuitive and since it isn’t very large, we dont even notice the extra time it takes.\n\n\n\n\n\n.apply() makes the most sense when:\n\nWhen your logic is complex and hard to vectorize\nYou have conditional transformations\nYou are in the EDA phase of your analysis\nYour dataset is small enough that you aren’t worried about how long it takes\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef categorize(score):\n    if score &gt;= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score &gt;= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score &gt;= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    else:\n        return \"Below C\"\n\ndf[\"grade\"] = df[\"score\"].apply(categorize)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\nresult\ngrade\n\n\n\n\n0\n72\nPass\nC\n\n\n1\n88\nPass\nB\n\n\n2\n95\nPass\nA\n\n\n3\n60\nFail\nBelow C\n\n\n4\n83\nPass\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the previous example, this helps the code to be easy to read and understand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest issue is size.\n.apply() as mentioned before works almost like a loop, meaning it performs the operations over and over where as other methods can do it all at once.
